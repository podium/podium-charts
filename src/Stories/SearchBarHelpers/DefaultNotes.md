# Search Bar
This is a very simple input component wrapped with styling. You can also pass in any additional input field props (`placeholder`, `value`, etc.) to fit your implementation use case. 

## Props
- onchange (function, required)
- width (string)
- rest (additional input props)

## Notes
You can add a custom width (percentage or pixel) to the search bar or it will default to 100% of the parent container.
